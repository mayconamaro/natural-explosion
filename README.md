# Naturals Explosion

## What is it?
A formally verified proof that if 0 equals 1 then all naturals are the same natural number.

## Why? It's about making a point.
It may look unuseful, but did you ever wondered the consequences of simple statements?
Have  you ever thought that simply supposing that zero equals one can lead to natural numbers being blown up?

## But not really. I'm just practicing Agda
Here, using the knowledge acquired with the Equality Chapter from the book Programming Language Foundations in Agda, I've proved that for practicing purposes. The proof is complete: every definition and property is explicitly defined (and proved).

## And you can use the idea to practice whatever you wish
Pull requests of this "theorem" in other proof assistants are very welcome :D. The proof is kinda simple, it only requires some properties of equality.

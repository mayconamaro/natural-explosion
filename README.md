# Naturals Explosion

You may find this unuseful, but did you ever wondered the consequences of simple statements?
Have  you ever thought that, if zero is equal to one, then every natural is the same number?

Here, using the knowledge acquired with the Equality Chapter from the book Programming Language Foundations in Agda, I've proved that for practicing purposes. The proof is complete: every definition and property is explicitly defined (and proved).

Pull requests of this "theorem" in other proof assistants are very welcome :D
